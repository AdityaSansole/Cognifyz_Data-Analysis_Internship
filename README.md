# Data Analysis of Restaurant Dataset - Cognifyz Internship

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant dataset, completed as part of the Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship. The goal was to derive actionable insights into various aspects of the restaurant business, including cuisine popularity, geographic distribution, pricing strategies, and the impact of online services.

## Key Insights & Findings

### Level 1: Foundational Analysis
* **Top Cuisines:** The market is dominated by **North Indian**, **Chinese**, and **Fast Food** cuisines.
* **City Analysis:** **New Delhi** has the highest volume of restaurants, but smaller markets like **Inner City** and cities in the Philippines boast the highest average ratings.
* **Price Distribution:** The vast majority of restaurants (~79%) are in the affordable (Level 1 & 2) price ranges.
* **Online Delivery:** Restaurants that offer online delivery have a **significantly higher average rating (3.25)** compared to those that do not (2.47).

### Level 2: Deeper Analysis
* **Rating Distribution:** The most common rating bracket for restaurants is **3-4 Stars**.
* **Cuisine Combinations:** Specialized combinations like **"North Indian, Mughlai"** are rated higher than more common, generic single-cuisine listings.
* **Geographic Distribution:** The dataset is heavily concentrated in **India**, with smaller clusters in the USA, UK, and UAE. The interactive map shows a high density of moderately-rated restaurants in the Indian market.
* **Restaurant Chains:** There is **no strong correlation between a chain's size and its rating**. The largest chain (Cafe Coffee Day) has a moderate rating, while a smaller chain (Barbeque Nation) is the highest-rated.

## Tools and Libraries
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (for static visualizations), Folium (for interactive maps).
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
